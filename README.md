# [Repl.it](https://repl.it) [Discord](https://discord.gg) Authenticator

A Discord bot to authenticate server members with their repl.it account.

> The bot should mute all non-authorized people, and unmute once they've 
> connected their discord to their repl.it account. It should use the 
> new repl auth system, and the database should be open to everyone.
